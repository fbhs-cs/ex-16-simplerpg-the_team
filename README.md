# Simple RPG

In this project, you will work with your group to create and test classes for use in a basic, text-based, RPG game.  We will discuss creating some parent (super) classes.  You will then `extend` (sub-class) the class or interface respectively to add additional functionality.

## Super Classes
To start the RPG we will make a parent (super) classes: `Character` class, a `Weapon` class, and a `Spell` class.  
* What attributes and actions will all characters have in common?  
* What attributes and actions will all weapons have in common?
* What attributes and actions will all spells have in common?

## Sub-Classes
To create a subclass, we `extend` a super class.  Each member of your group will be responsible for the following:
* Create a specific kind of player character class by exending character and write a test class.
   For example, if you make a `Warrior` class, you would need to write `TestWarrior` with a `main` method that will instantiate a `Warrior` object and test all of its methods.
* Create a specific kind of enemy character class by extending character and write a test class.
* Create a specific kind of weapon by extending `Weapon` and write a test class.
* Create a specific spell by extending `Spell` and write a test class.
* Create a *special* weapon or spell that extends your created weapon or spell that adds additional functionality

## Game Class
I will provide some starter code for a `Game` class at a later time that you will modify and use to play a game using your created weapons, spells, and characters.
